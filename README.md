<p>Welcome to <em>Creatures of the Night</em>, an endless runner game where the goal is to defeat enough night creatures before the timer expires. Follow the adventures of Blackjack, a curious little furry adventurer who has wandered off too far from his normal route on his morning walk. Help him find his way back home to his lovely wife Undgretta before the sun goes down and he finds himself spending the night outdoors amongst the creepy-crawlies of the forest.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To host the game on your local server via Parcel, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Run the following npm command: <code>npm install</code></li>
  <li>Run the following npm command: <code>npm run dev</code></li>
</ol>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>Parameters for type checking are set in <code>tsconfig.json</code>. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html">official documentation</a>. By default, Parcel does not perform any type checking. This is why <code>--noEmit</code> is set to <code>true</code>. Type checking may also be achieved by running <code>tsc --noEmit</code> in a separate terminal.</p>
<p>Parameters for automated code formatting are set in <code>prettier.config.js</code>. For more information, see the <a href="https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration.html">official documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>HTML</strong> - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It is used to structure and format content on the web, and to create interactive content like forms and buttons. HTML is a fundamental building block of the web and is used to create the structure and layout of web pages. For more information, see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">official documentation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>SaSS</strong> - SaSS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a style sheet language that is used to style web pages written in HTML. It is a preprocessor that adds features such as variables, mixins, and functions to CSS. SaSS allows developers to write cleaner and more efficient stylesheets, and can make it easier to maintain and update styles across a large web application. For more information, see the <a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation">official documentation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>TypeScript</strong> - TypeScript is a programming language that is a super set of JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which can help to improve the reliability and maintainability of code. TypeScript is especially useful for large codebases, as it can catch errors before the code is even run. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html">official documentation</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>JavaScript</strong> - JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used to create interactive content on the web. It is often used in combination with HTML and CSS to create dynamic and interactive websites. In this project, JavaScript is also used to implement object-oriented programming through the use of classes, which were introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 6). For more information, see the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">official documentation</a>.
